The project i have uploaded into this repository is designed to take the user input (In this case, the amount of beer cans they comsume alongside their cost per can), then calculate and display different values based on:

1. How much they consume and spend per day

2. How much is consumed and spent per year

3. How many calories and pounds they gain per year on beer cans alone

The concepts employed through this project were to practice compiling and running simple programs, using arithmetic expressions and assignment statements to produce calculations, and reading input from the user.
